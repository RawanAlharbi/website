I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University.
I work in the interdisciplinary Health Aware Bits (HABits) lab directed by my advisor Prof. Nabil Alshurafa.


I am interested in designing and building accessible human-centered wearable systems that enhance wellbeing.
For my Ph.D. research, I focus on improving data collection methods to enhance the privacy and accountability of behavioral sensing wearable systems.
