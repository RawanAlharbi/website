I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University. I work in the interdisciplinary Health Aware Bits (HABits) lab directed by my advisor Prof. Nabil Alshurafa.

 I work in the intersection of **human-computer interaction**, **systems**, and **machine learning**, exploring how we can build intelligent, efficient, and responsible wearable systems that can sustain their efficacy as they integrate into everyday life.
